> Proof of concept for a bash service. [Why?]

## Requirements
- [xinetd-org/xinetd]

## Installation
Copy [xinetd.d/beeroclock] over to their proper directory. Then update
`/etc/services` by commenting out port `80` and adding the following:
`beeroclock 80/tcp www`

Then depending on the location of this directory, you'll have to update [line 128]
which contains the path to the favicon.
